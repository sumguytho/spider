This jar archive is a modification of asm by objectweb. This archive is produced as if sources of asm:asm and asm:asm-tree were merged and compiled into a single jar.

Every source file has been repackaged from org.objectweb.asm to sumguytho.asm.mod. ClassReader has been modified so that instead of failing when encountering non-JVMS compliant classes it makes best effort to parse them as valid.

Modified by sumguytho.
